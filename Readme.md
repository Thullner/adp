ASD - ADP
=============
- This project contains the code for _Implementatie van algoritmes en datastructuren_ for the course _ASD - ADP_ 2021-2022.
- The code is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Thullner/adp). 
- All unit tests are run with Github Actions
- To prevent naming conflicts with C#, all classnames are prefixed with `Adp`.

Implementations
---------------

### Algorithms
- Contains all the algorithm implementations. All algorithms are implemented, with the exception of the TimSort algorithm.

### DataStructures
- Contains all the data structures implementations


Tests
-------
- Contains unit tests for all algorithms and data structures.

Benchmarks
---------------
- Contains benchmarks for the AdpDynamicArray. Benchmarks for other data structures and algorithms were not performed because of time constraints.
